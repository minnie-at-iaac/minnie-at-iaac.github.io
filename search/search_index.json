My view is that prototypes are the precursors to a product or a \u201cfinal\u201d piece. </p> <p>While I am familiar with Prototyping, I mainly use it for design practice and not in design research. The discussion on the four roles has shifted my view. Here are the four roles:</p> <ul> <li>Role 1: The prototype as an experimental component</li> <li>Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry</li> <li>Role 3: The prototype as a research archetype</li> <li>Role 4: The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry</li> </ul> <p>Admittedly it was a little confusing at first, to assign these multiple definitions, opening the term to a broader \u2018spectrum\u2019(?). My previous perspective on prototyping revolves around Role 1. Role 2 for me is \u201cData Gathering\u201d. Roles 3 and 4 seem like more artistic explorations.</p> <p>My take is Roles 3 and 4, perhaps even Role 2, I think can still be broken down into Role 1. When making a prototype that allows for Inquuiry, it can still be broken down into a subprocess of iterative prototyping. One that still probes a hyptothesis, maybe in a looser fashion. </p> <p>I might be getting it wayy off here but the emphasis on looking at prototyping, recognizing that the iterative process provides insights, if not answers, to an inquiry is/can be relevant to one\u2019s research. </p> <p>Reading the reference Prototypes and prototyping in design research brings me more clarity on this topic.</p>"},{"location":"term1/03-Design-studio/Design-studio-01/#prototyping-activity","title":"Prototyping Activity","text":"<p>The prompt is to create a new prototype for one of our classmate\u2019s previous project.

With this information, the user is now more aware of their impact. </p> <p>The original prototype is an app with a specific purpose - to inform, so I suppose that it functions as Role 1. If the data is collected and analyzed, then it would overlap with Role 2.</p> <p>For my prototype, I wanted to explore Role 3 and create one that explores/facilitates reflection and discussion. A physical scale for two people/users where they will (in)put their food intake. The scale tips according to their projected carbon footprint. The prototype aims to encourage both people to talk about their food, backgrounds, etc. and perhaps find a way to strike a balance.</p> <p> </p> <p>to do: make gif</p>"},{"location":"term1/04-Atlas-of-weak-signals/Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/","title":"Atlas of Weak Signals","text":"<p>For most of us, the term, as well as the concept of \u201cAtlas of Weak Signals\u201d, is new.
