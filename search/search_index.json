My view is that prototypes are the precursors to a product or a \u201cfinal\u201d piece. </p> <p>While I am familiar with Prototyping, I mainly use it for design practice and not in design research. The discussion on the four roles has shifted my view. Here are the four roles:</p> <ul> <li>Role 1: The prototype as an experimental component</li> <li>Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry</li> <li>Role 3: The prototype as a research archetype</li> <li>Role 4: The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry</li> </ul> <p>Admittedly it was a little confusing at first, to assign these multiple definitions, opening the term to a broader \u2018spectrum\u2019(?). My previous perspective on prototyping revolves around Role 1. Role 2 for me is \u201cData Gathering\u201d. Roles 3 and 4 seem like more artistic explorations.</p> <p>My take is Roles 3 and 4, perhaps even Role 2, I think can still be broken down into Role 1. When making a prototype that allows for Inquuiry, it can still be broken down into a subprocess of iterative prototyping. One that still probes a hyptothesis, maybe in a looser fashion. </p> <p>I might be getting it wayy off here but the emphasis on looking at prototyping, recognizing that the iterative process provides insights, if not answers, to an inquiry is/can be relevant to one\u2019s research. </p> <p>Reading the reference Prototypes and prototyping in design research brings me more clarity on this topic.</p>"},{"location":"term1/03-Design-studio/Design-studio-01/#prototyping-activity","title":"Prototyping Activity","text":"<p>The prompt is to create a new prototype for one of our classmate\u2019s previous project.

A physical scale for two people/users where they will (in)put their food intake. The scale tips according to their projected carbon footprint.
