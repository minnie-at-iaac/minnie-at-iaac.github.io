In some cases, components can be easily separated to facilitate updates without changing the entire design, such as the iPod input part being separated from the acoustic box for Apple hardware updates.</p> <p>What surprised you?</p> <p>PCBs are intriguing, and we can tell that most of them originates from Mexico (or at least where assembled there). The modularity of the connection dock for the iPod or early iPhone with 30-pin connectors suggests that it might be more convenient for production to replace the entire module while preserving the speaker and amplifier PCB.
