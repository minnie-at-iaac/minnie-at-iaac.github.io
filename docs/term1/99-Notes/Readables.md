Here I will try to document things I've read, maybe put some notes.

### Design As Learning
!!! note Notes
    - First book to borrow from the ELISAVA library!

### Slow Reader

!!! note Notes
    - I like the title because I AM a slow reader
    - The projects and experiments that are used as examples are quite interesting! But I still take into account that these may have been cherry-picked and maybe  there ARE down-sides/failed examples that are not discussed.
    - I think the book needs pictures or illustrations at least

### Design Justice

### Friction

### Socail Matter, Social Design
