title: Machine Paradox Reflection
---

The seminar is divided into two parts. The first week, we had to take apart "broken" machines and make a forensic report and in the second week we had to create a new machine with working components from the broken machines.

## Forensics of the obsolescence
Our group had (too much) fun in taking things apart that we disassembled 3 things. Of those, we fixed one: a Dremel, and the other two, we included in our forensic report.

## Right to Hack
### Sony CRT

Probably the coolest part we found was the mini CRT screen inside the intercom. It's a nice piece of "old tech". We were also able to turn it on and it is able to get some sort of "signal" (looks more like noise) by connecting it to a raspberry pi. 

For several days, the FABLAB team and instructors helped in figuring out the screen. At the time of writing, we are more confident that the screen is actually working and usable, because it behaves similar to the other devices with composite video input which we tested with the Raspberry pi: a projector and Guillem's mini TV. All of these were able to vaguely show a boot up screen of the rapsberry pi for a few seconds and then they go back to emitting noise. So I think it's just a matter of finding a way of sending a correct signal. We just ran out of time but I'd like to be able to make it work, maybe in the next/another project.

This is also the first time I used a Raspberry pi and I've always wanted one (but it is a bit expensive).


## Rethink and Reconnect

From our stash, the screen from the intercom and the speakers from the BOSE SoundDock were the only components that were working. Since we could only turn the screen on and off, we had to just use it as a light source. 

Instead of using the amplifier board from the BOSE SoundDock, we used another amplifier and eventually a DF Player Mini - so we could control the sounds via an arduino.

### Concept
We settled on the idea of anxiety, and how we can manifest it in a sort of game/toy.

## Reflection

### Wonders of the FABLAB
I like that we have access to all these machines, tools and parts. Although we did use parts I brought from home like my arduino and some push buttons, the things in and the FABLAB spaces are super helpful. I could on only think of the Fablab/makerspaces/workshops back home, and how can we/I find a way to replicate this. Just imagine the all ideas that can emerge! 

### Making our Machine
We only had 3 days to make the machine, video and presentation. It was so exhausting and my brain is fried.

Admittedly, having a Computer Science background, there was a bit of pressure (from myself) to make it all work incredibly well. It would have been nice to have all the components integrated, the code could have been more optimized and cleaner, the wiring and connections could have been more robust and stable. But it is what it is. Maybe I'll fix things when we showcase it in the exhibit that Chiara mentioned.

### Latinos y Filipino

Before we started, we had to group ourselves making sure that each group is composed of people with different skillsets (in project management, building, electronics). Our group is called {-- Minnie & --} Minnions //hahaha// with me, Ever, Vania, Jorge and Panchi. It was a great team effort with Panchi modelling the casing, Jorge making the sounds and soldering the wires, Ever making the buttons and finding parts we could use and Vania staying on top of things, while I programmed the arduino.  It was really fun working with them!! Happy and grateful <3
