# Making a (living/non-living) Companion

## This is Taco

Taco is made of a pizza container, bottle caps, milk carton and some cable ties.  

## Reflection
**how will you live together?**  
Taco just chills out on any flat surface. Sometimes it goes with me in my bag or I hold it. 
what does it notice? Taco is a silent observer of the world with its 360o vision. It takes in things that are interesting (I put shiny foil-like wraps inside as we go). It likes to be petted, but when you push too hard, it will “bite” back.  

**what were you thinking?**  
I wanted to tackle something that is very me: curiosity, and something that is not so much: vengeance. When I saw the sharp ring from the milk container, I thought of making the retractable teeth “mechanism”. After making I realized it kinda looks like these soy sauce packets.  

**why does it matter?**  
In many ways, we share the same approach to the world: passively and slowly taking in. It also signifies that there are instances when one needs to fight. This more active action is something I need to learn/practice more.
