# Documenting Design

Most documentations I've done before are very objective as they needed to cater to the user or client. In contrast, what we need to do for this subject is to create one that is like a personal blog. There is a learning curve in setting up and "designing"/formatting the websites. I'm also not much of a writer, so it's gonna be challenging to write weekly reflections and content for this.

I have previous experience with git and coding so I also made an [FAQ page](/term1/02-Documenting-design/Git-problems), hope it helps.
