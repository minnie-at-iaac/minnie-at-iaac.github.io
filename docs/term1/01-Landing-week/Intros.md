# Program Introductions

We met Tomas, Guillem and Laura. The other faculty were introduced via Zoom.

# Reflection

- I've never had a philosophy class as deep/intense before
- Lots of new terminologies to google, and looks like there are many more to come
- The structure of having different seminars and schedules every week is new to me, might be tricky to remember
- The calendar looks packed, (I'm hoping I can still find part-time job)
