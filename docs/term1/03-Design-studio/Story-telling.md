07-November Session with Laura
```



The monday session with Laura was all about narrative and story-telling.

### Personal vs Narrative vs Narration vs Story-telling

### Power
According to Espinosa (to do: look up), Potestas and Potentia, Power as negative/oppressive and Power as positive/empowering respectively, are happening simultaneously.

### Wor(l)ding
is an active, ontological process...putting the attention on theh different entanglements

### Books to read
- Sonic Agency by Brandon La Belle
- Vibrant Matter by Jane Bennett
- Staying with the Trouble

### Exercises
#### How were you collected today?
Sunlight felt particularly special that day as I tended to slow my pace as I walked in the few spots where the sun directly hit. Looking back, it was a signal that I needed to heal and recharge (got sick the next day). 
#### String game
We all shared our thoughts about the shared experiences we've had,as a class/community, while making this large web of red yarn.

## Reflection
Honestly, I was starting to feel under the weather that day which might be the reason why I was having a hard time grasping the lesson and exercises. What I'm beginning to understand and appreciate is the careful attention that are placed on the word/terms and their meanings. Air quotes have been used frequently. 

I am still behind on the things I want to read to better understand the philosophy topics being discussed. 

I still don't know if I'm doing this right.
