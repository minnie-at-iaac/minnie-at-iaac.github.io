# Program Introductions

We met Tomas, Guillem and Laura. The other faculty were introduced via Zoom.

# Reflection

!!! warning "Work in progress..."
    To do: type this out properly

- never had a philosophy class as deep/intense before
- lots of new terminologies to google, and looks like there are many more to come
- the structure of having different seminars and schedules every week is new to me, might be tricky to remember
- calendar looks packed, (i'm hoping i can still find part-time job)
- really exciting days ahead
