# Less Careless
Less Careless is the the working title because well, primarily, it sounds catchy and I want to delve further into the concept of caring. For the Design Dialogues, I tackled the topics around climate, accountability, co-creation.

## Interventions
In my area, I showed 4 "mini-interventions":
### what if??
I asked:   
If I were the CEO of <insert corporation here>, I will ________

### shed light on trash
An interactive lamp made of scrap materials, which lights up as one holds it

### meta-shared-spaces
For a week, I sent people from different Fablabs and makerspaces here in Barcelona and the Philippines, a site where they would answer a questionnaire asking about one's current activities in the lab, materials and opinions regarding the Donut Economic Model. The answers of these participants were presented in a visual and interactive way. 

### el basuradar
What if planet earth made a trash detection AI?

## Other Interventions
### Human to Machine | Machine to Machine

### Micro to Macro

## Reflection
It was interesting to receive reactions and discuss my topics of interest. "el basuradar" had the most fun reactions, as it subverted the expectations of people. A machine calling a person "trash", despite its humor, allows for the conversation of what it means to label something as trash or waste; where does waste begin? can we create a different perspective on trash? 

I am really thankful for friends here at IAAC, in the Philippines, and other makers that took time from their busy lives to participate in my intervention. To be critical, as much as I wanted it to be as meaningful to them as it was to me, I think that the site/prototype I created still lacked refinement. However, it has brought a lot of relevant ideas to me. Thru meta-shared-spaces, I was able to get a glimpse of the differences and similiarities in perspactives. Some participants were willing to help me out further, so the next step is to reach out to them. In particular, I plan on getting to know more about and hopefully collaborate with Ateneu de Fabcricio in Nou Barris and Akasha Hub.

There is still a lot to process for the next term, we shall see.
