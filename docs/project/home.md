# **UNTRASH: being in-between trash, sounds and community**
(working title)

![](../images/Thesis/circuits_no_tirar.jpg)

**Research question/s:** 

**What does it mean to redefine our coexistence with trash for an alternative present, transitioning towards climate consciousness, waste decolonization and post-growth future? How might the interconnections between sounds, music, co-creation, climate and materials challenge the status quo?**

Untrashing is a collection of artifacts/instruments and series of activities where trash-bound/landfill-bound/ocean-bound objects are (re)collected, then transformed into musical instruments - from material landscapes into collective soundscapes. The resulting objects and sounds are presented in the final exhibition to the visitors, allowing them to also play together.

The exhibition, in MDEFest, aims to serve as meditation on the enduring legacy of discarded plastics, e-waste and rejected objects destined to become pollutants. The way waste is externalized within the predominant systems of capitalism and consumerism, has caused harm for some groups of people more than others, and it’s bound to continue for generations to come. 

Guided by the somber echoes of "kapwa" – a Filipino term for our interconnectedness with others, similar to Haraway’s “making oddkin” – Untrashing challenges conventional points of view, inviting participants to consider the profound consequences of consumptive excess and to act in resistance by focusing on care and responsibility (response-ability?) to the materiality around us.
