Here is the [documentation](https://hackmd.io/@kotsengkuba/Bk007Xco6) for the first microchalleng I did with Panchi!

## Reflection

- a movement away from high level software, which is a refreshing take from the coding we’ve been doing - i say this as a programmer, it’s a good feeling to not be forced to always make software
- highlighting the process of craft, working with the tangible, the hands-on  experimentation
- as someone who is/was really inspired by the Precious Plastic Project, I really wanted to try the different machines myself.
- “Urban foraging” - a new way of looking at trash and the city. As we take on the process of ‘revaluing’, we also become more aware of the identity/life/characteristics of the city/nearby neighborhoods in barcelona. As we collect objects, we get to know or seek to know the contexts from which they come - who used them, where did we get them, how much and how frequent are they discarded
- Ultimately Panchi and I found that the materials we’ve been developing have a lot of potential and the process was enjoyable.
- From this learning experience, our goal is to create a design piece integrating various processes. Also exploring making molds for jewelry stones, working with the CNC, experimenting with sewing machines and pressed plastic bags, and to integrate the design within the community.
- We also want to explore parametric design in creating tileable/connectable pieces. This adds to the fun of mixing and matching different printed patterns that come with the materials.
