For the exercise ethical-constructive technology assessment, Flora, Manuja and I analysed the blue LED. A little object that most of us in the digital age take for granted.

## Reflection

The complex relationship of humans with technology, products and the built environment has shaped individual lives and collective wellbeing. It has also greatly affected, even disrupted, nature and other species. 

For my MDEF project (and my own design practice), I'm focused on critically looking at the lack of consideration taken toward the consequences of waste, the by-products of production and consumption. Many people, the marginalized, especially in the Global South, are forced to live their lives around and adapt to these "trash" and externalities of the Global North.

This seminar would have been good to have during my bachelors, to ingrain early on the sense of responsibility in design.

The seminar was only for two (half) days, too short for discussing many things especially in the context of our MDEF projects. I wish it had been longer, which is the same way I feel for the talk of Helen Torres.

Nevertheless, it was a good reminder that design doesn't take place in a vacuum. Our (design) decisions have consequences and Ariel has taught us different ways to uncover them. 

## Self-evaluation
Grade: 7  
Honestly, I was not feeling too well during the seminar. As I am trying to tackle the ethical implications of waste, I think that I could have done more for this seminar.
