The AoWS cards were developed in 2xxx, in the early days of the Mdef program. A lot has changed since hence the necessity to update the cards.

Our group, with Albert, Dhrishya and Flora, tackled the theme of "Biological" initially. We discussed various interests and things that we found as emerging.

We have reached a conclusion that is: What is becoming more and more apparent within the polycrisis is the interconnectedness of things (surprise surprise). While it is / can be common sense to propose aN  empathetic, conscious ways of living, it is a powerful concept/signal that we felt valuable to explore. 

We designed our proposals and proceeded to map  them in an embodied activity.
